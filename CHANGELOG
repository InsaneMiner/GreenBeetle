DEV SERVER:
dev server did not work with threading because it was exiting while also trying to run. 
I fixed this by making sure that we wait for the threads before we exit.
I made a list of running threads(the list of running threads is only the ssl server and normal one) 
then looped through them and used join to make sure that we waited for them.
URL ROUTING:
there was code in default/app/urls.py that was needed. The library handles routing, 
but the old code used to not so the code was for routing. So what is left is just a dict for urls.
DOCUMENTATION:
I added some more info documentation.
TEMPLATES:
templates now use jinja2 instead of lemons stupid template thing.
